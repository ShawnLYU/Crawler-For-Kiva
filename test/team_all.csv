Join us and enjoy the ride. Mindfulness is not a religion or a system of political beliefs. It is a way of improving your life and seeing more beauty in it by becoming aware of what really is going on around you instead of listening to your ever-going mind that usually doesn't have an ""off"" button. The central thinking has much in common with many other philosophies. The focus is on trying to improve your own life by being present in everything that you do, to leave the past behind, and to be content to leave the future, as it must be, unknown.  The only thing we now have is the present, which we think of as a gift.
