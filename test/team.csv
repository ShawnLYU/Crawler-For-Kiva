Reproduction is used, consciously or not, as a means to control women, to limit their options and to make them subordinate to men. In many societies a serious approach to reproductive health has to have this perspective in mind. We must seek to liberate women."" -  Dr. Nafis Sadik Executive Director, UN Population Fund - \n\n**** THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD HEALTH & EDUCATION TO A WOMAN'S WELL-BEING - AND THAT OF HER FAMILY & SOCIETY - CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. \n\n - - Without reproductive health and freedom, women cannot fully exercise their fundamental human rights, such as those relating to education and employment. Yet around the world, the right to health, and especially reproductive and sexual health, is far from a reality for many women. According to the World Bank, a full one-third of the illness among women ages 15-44 in developing countries is related to pregnancy, childbirth, abortion, reproductive tract infections, and human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).  Women's disproportionate poverty, low social status, and reproductive role expose them to high health risks, resulting in needless and largely preventable suffering and deaths. Many of the women and girls who die each year during pregnancy and childbirth could have been saved by relatively low-cost improvements in reproductive healthcare; yet high levels of maternal mortality persist. The benefits of eliminating the harmful and painful practice of female genital mutilation are easily demonstrated, yet it persists for cultural and traditional reasons. And a large proportion of abortions, some resulting in death and injury, would be avoided if women and men had access to safe, affordable and effective means of contraception. - -       \nhttp://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womrepro.htm - - - - - - - - \n\n**** EVERY MINUTE, A WOMAN DIES IN PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH - -  this adds up to more than 10 million over a generation. - - Almost all of these women - 99 per cent - live and die in developing countries. A high maternal death rate is an indicator of an inadequate health care system, including those that offer poor and only limited access to health services. It also indicates that a woman’s fundamental rights to life and health are being violated. - - - Yet the vast majority of maternal deaths could be prevented. In industrialized countries, deaths owing to pregnancy and childbirth are rare. The maternal death rate in East Asia and Latin America has also decreased - by as much as 50 per cent in some countries. But in Africa and South Asia, complications during pregnancy and childbirth remain the most frequent cause of death for women. - - In some countries the number is increasing. And when women suffer and die, children suffer and die also. - - We know what it takes to save women’s lives: universal access to contraception to avoid unintended pregnancies, access to skilled care during delivery, and rapid access to quality emergency obstetric care when required. - - - - - \n\n**** THE CURRENT SITUATION  •  Every year, 536,000 women die from pregnancy related causes. This adds up to more than 10 million women over a generation. Every year, more than 1 million children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death.  Children who have lost their mothers are up to 10 times more likely to die prematurely than those who haven’t. The risk of a woman dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth during her lifetime is about 1 in 7 in Niger and about 1 in 48,000 in Ireland. 10-15 million women a year suffer severe or long-lasting illnesses or disabilities caused by complications during pregnancy or childbirth. These range from obstetric fistula to infertility and depression. The main reasons for maternal deaths are haemorrhage, infections, unsafe abortions, high blood pressure leading to seizures and obstructed labor. - - - - \n\n**** CONTRACEPTION & UNSAFE ABORTIONS - - - -  200 million women want to delay or avoid pregnancy but are not using effective contraceptives. One in three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had access to it. An estimated 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year in developing countries. Every year, an estimated 68,000 women die as the result of unsafe abortions and millions more suffer complications. About 90% of abortion-related deaths and disabilities worldwide could be avoided if women who wished to had access to effective contraception. - - -  \n\n*** SKILLED ASSISTANCE & EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC CARE • The number of maternal deaths is highest in countries where women are least likely to have skilled attendance at delivery. • Worldwide, 62 per cent of births are attended by a skilled health worker. Almost all births in developed countries are attended. In less developed countries, the figure is 57 per cent. In least developed countries it falls to only 34 per cent. • An estimated 35 per cent of pregnant women in developing countries do not have contact with health personnel prior to giving birth. • In sub-Saharan Africa, where most maternal deaths occur, about 70 per cent have no contact with health personnel following childbirth. • Mortality is highest during labour and the two days following a birth. • Women who undergo infibulation—a radical form of female genital mutilation that involves stitching of the external genitalia—are at higher risk of complications during and following childbirth - -  http://www.unfpa.org/safemotherhood/mediakit/documents/fs/factsheet1_eng.pdf","*** ""Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity"": \n - -  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Humanist_Association - - - - - - - - - - - -     \n***\nFreethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or any other dogma. The cognitive application of freethought is known as freethinking, and practitioners of freethought are known as freethinkers: - - \nFreethought holds that individuals should neither accept nor reject ideas proposed as truth without recourse to knowledge and reason. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of facts, scientific inquiry, and logical principles, independent of any factual/logical fallacies or the intellectually-limiting effects of authority, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, sectarianism, tradition, urban legend, and all other dogmatic or otherwise fallacious principles. Applied to religion, freethinkers have generally held that, given presently-known facts, established scientific theories, and logical principles, there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of supernatural phenomena. - - - - -\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought",http://www.halftheskymovement.org/,2009-08-19T18:55:27Z,open,104,2714,68350

In fact, on National Help Out Others Day, Blottosobians sometimes get into bloody street fights over who gets to help whom.","You don't have to live in the Republic of Blottosobia to celebrate the character, values, and traditions of its people.  Things like saying the first thing that pops into your head without thinking, eating lots of fried food, having substantial arm hair, wearing raincoats inside out, and being kind to squirrels.  One interesting fun fact:  In Blottosobia, floors are numbered from the top of the building down. It is thus important before getting into an elevator to determine how many stories the building has or you won't know which floor to get off on. Further complicating the matter is that the numbers 2, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, and 22 are considered unlucky and there are no floors with those numbers.  A Blottosobia travel tip:  Because of a metal shortage, the Blottosobian central government in 1999 banned making change after a retail purchase. Nowadays, if customers overpay a merchant, he writes an IOU on their arms or legs with a Sharpie pen. This IOU is good for future purchases, and gets crossed off their arms or legs by the merchant when the IOU is used. ",,2008-09-24T02:53:09Z,open,7,130,3775

It is our belief that as we foster entrepreneurship, economic prosperity follows, more jobs are created, and poverty is reduced. Meanwhile the individual gains financial independence, an essential key to individual freedom. Neither reduction in poverty or individual freedom were the original goals of the entrepreneur, but they are the unintended consequences from which all of us benefit.","Individuals who join this group want to increase FREEDOM in the world, primarily individual FREEDOM.

The mental health budget from Bali's governor was cut by 90% last year.\n\nThe few Indonesian psychological institutions that exist look more like a prision then a hospital.

They believe mental illness is a curse, because of to little dedication to religion, and therefore it's a punishment by the gods. \n\nAs the mental ill patients sometimes show “strange“ behavior, their family puts them in heavy iron chains or lock them away in cages or wooden sheds for the rest of their lives. There are even reported cases that mental ill are brought to the jungle, where they die of starvation.\n","We are shocked about - Paradise Island - Bali's hidden and dark secret: the inhuman suffering and torturing of mental ill patients. \n\nTherefore we are very impressed by the good work of Dr. Luh Ketut Suryuni of the Suryani Institute. \n\nWith the resources the institute has today, who is mainly depending on donations, she is able to help about 600 patients. Just 1 injection every 2 weeks can help a patient to live a relatively normal life, but these drugs are very expensive.

She learned of Kiva while reading a magazine, and found the features of being able to see photos, and being able to learn about specific borrowers appealing. Aimee’s friends ‘of like mind’ in her region know of Kiva, but she feels the members of her larger circle on Facebook mostly do not. She does not think that in general, Kiva is very well known in her area.\n\nAimee chooses her loans first by looking for ones in danger of expiring. Her husband is a farmer, so she has a tendency to support agricultural loans in other parts of the world, but also favours loans to widows and families improving their sanitation conditions.\n\nAs for women’s rights, Aimee states that women have equal rights in the United States, and enjoy equal protection under the law. She feels women have opportunities equal to men’s, as well, but notes that there is not yet equal pay for equal work.\n\nAimee is raising two young children (6 and 2), but still follows individual interests including yoga and cooking. She is an active parent, and takes her children to activities such as swimming, dance, and Cub Scouts. Aimee enjoys the aspect of scouting which involves teaching volunteering to her son. She works part time as a paralegal, and enjoys her work very much. She is also a consultant for keeping potentially harmful chemicals out of homes. Aimee donates blood regularly, and has just joined the bone marrow donor registry. \n\nThings which Aimee particularly likes about her country include personal safety, plentiful food, and clean water, all of which contribute to very positive quality of life. She notes in a lighter vein that she notices marked cultural differences wherever she goes within the United States, which she finds ‘one of the coolest things’ about the USA.\n\nMy thanks to Aimee for participating in this interview.\n\nTom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",,2010-04-14T18:34:47Z,open,1805,40438,1125225

Last year while living in South Africa, Melissa, Sadie, Cole and I saw firsthand how people in poverty live. I’ve learned how poor people don’t really want “hand outs”, but could certainly use a “hand up”.\n\nThis holiday season, the only gift I really want is for my friends and family to experience what that means to me. All it will take is 25 minutes and a loan of $25. KIVA.org is a website that allows you to make a $25 loan to a micro-entrepreneur in a developing country, so that they can build a business to develop income and provide for their family. On the website, you can choose the specific entrepreneur and the business that you want to lend to: for example a restaurateur in Cambodia, a goat herder in Uganda, or a farmer in Peru. Since 2005, KIVA has provided over 340,000 loans worth $260M dollars with an amazing 98.3% repayment rate. That means you not only help someone get their business off the ground, but history says there is a 98.3% chance you get your $25 back! KIVA has won many awards, and has been profiled by Time Magazine, Fortune, New York Times, not to mention being named as one of Oprah’s favorite things.\n\nI’ve created an online lending team with KIVA called “Friends of Sadie and Cole” and am hoping you can help me get to a total of 25 loans on there by Dec 25. Click here: http://www.kiva.org/team/friends_of_sadie_and_cole to learn more.\n\nHere’s a short video on how it works: http://vimeo.com/16991128\n\n25 minutes and $25 could be a game changer to help someone in the developing world get on their feet in 2012. Would love to hear your opinions and what you thought about the experience. \n\nThanks and looking forward to celebrating this holiday season with you, whether in person or from afar!\n\nAlbert",http://vimeo.com/16991128,2011-11-30T22:27:44Z,open,50,437,11950

Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \n\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\n\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world.

Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\n\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.

We believe that \nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers (and probably raise the interest rates or fees they have to pay to get a loan)..\n\nWe can't save every red-boxed loan, but we try to\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/56782.Loren_Eiseley\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\n\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\n* the basket amount\nClick magnifier icon for more info.  Or read Charlotte’s post at @Charlotte re: #346848\nAlso known as ""CW,"" or ""Charlotte's Web of Wonders""\n\nWe invite you to join us and make a difference, too. Please check the team board at 2 am Kiva time, 7 am Kiva time, 1 pm Kiva time and 6 pm Kiva time to coordinate lending.\nKiva time means PST - Pacific Standard Time, the time zone of San Francisco, where Kiva HQ is. They follow daylight saving time in the summer.\n\nSee our team fund page:\nhttp://www.kiva.org/lender/kivalllfund","Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\n""Expiring Soon"" option instead of the default ""Popularity"", and then work to get them funded.\n\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\n\n“You’ve Got Email,” as explained by team member Tim:   It's a twice a month email that goes out to the Kiva lenders who have funds sitting unused in their accounts. Mainly the smaller lenders who don't look obsessively at Kiva and are likely not to be aware that they are in credit. Usually linked to the Expiring Loans list and therefore it creates a sort of house cleaning effect there. Today (April 10, 2016) was unusual in that it came out on a Sunday, so the effect has been more muted and will last longer. When it happens Monday - Friday, the impact is amazing with loaning suddenly peaking at 60-90 loans a minute.\n\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says ""Only x days left!"" or \n""Only x hours and y minutes left!""\n\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \nlenders work together to keep loans from \nexpiring.\n\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \nwill be included in the period immediately after \neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\n\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\n\nOPM - Abbreviation for ""other people's money.""  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's ""popularity"" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\n\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are posted by the SFDD list-makers when there are not enough loans set to expire in a Starfish window to populate an SFDD list.  The RTR lists contains loans with planned expirations later in the Kiva cycle.  ""Red"" is a reference to the red \nboxes that are added to a loan description \nwhen the loan is about to expire without full \nfunding.\n\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\n\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as ""Starfish,"" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\n\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds and to move into paying back status.\n\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.  As a rule of thumb, in a loan's last 24 hours on Kiva, it's more likely to end up fully funded if its Lars ratio is no greater than 100.  (I.e., if it needs to raise no more than $100 per hour.)\n(Developed by team member Lars)\n\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation ""again walker,"" meaning ""undead,"" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\n\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation ""ugly words.""  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\n\nWindmills (as in ""tilting at windmills""): From the book The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.  It refers to a knight on a horse running at a windmill with his lance, attempting to ""defeat"" the windmill (the failure of which act is a foregone conclusion). When an expiring loan is referred to as a windmill, people are saying that they think the loan may be a lost cause already ... but since we're all gluttons for punishment, and since you never know what will happen on Kiva, sometimes we take a run at the loan anyway!  \n\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\nhttp://kivatools.com\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\nSee loans in real time, as they are made: http://kivalive.com/index2.php\nSee ""the fireworks"" when lending is very fast:\nhttp://www.kiva.org/live\n\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \nboard.

The University retains the initials in honour of the principal donor for that College – Nadirshaw Edulji Dinshaw in its name! Like other such Government owned institutions in developing countries, it has had over the years to overcome various handicaps ranging from shortage of funds to “brain drain” of Faculty Members as well as students. Nevertheless, because of its transparent admission policy which has established its reputation over the years, it attracts the best students – including even some foreigners lacking resources for seeking admission in Universities of developed countries!\n\nThis University presently offers undergraduate programmes in Twenty Five (25) Engineering disciplines along with one each in Architecture and in Computer Science and Information Technology. It is also presently offering Thirty-Four (34) Master’s level postgraduate programmes; this number is also increasing each year. At present, the programmes for Doctoral studies are restricted to Faculty Members; this university is implementing its wide-ranging Development Programme in which its demands for Faculty Development are of such intensity that they leave no room for offering Doctorate programmes for external candidates.\n\nThe independent Internet Facility installed in June 1999 was the first of its kind – making this University an independent Internet Service Provider for internal usage. This facility has since been augmented by the PERN facility provided by the Higher Education Commission and supplemented by the portal facility for usage by all its Departments. This University has also been one of – if not the very first – in establishing liaison with industries, public utilities and companies engaged in Consultancy and Construction activities. These efforts have greatly facilitated and also extended its scope for students obtaining gainful employment almost immediately after graduation. This University can thus – without pretending to possess the ability to provide its students the same facilities as in developed countries – certainly offer them intellectual challengers in competing with students possessing abilities of level equal to if not sometimes higher than those in developed countries. \n",,2012-07-18T16:06:00Z,open,5,75,1875
